# Towards a Fair Evaluation Protocol in NAS for SRIR

This repository contains the elements necessary to apply the evaluation protocol found in **"An Experimental Protocol for Neural Architecture Search in Super-Resolution"**.

This Protocol focuses on enforcing similarity of conditions for the proper contrast between different neural architecture search procedures. Moreover this protocol extend the current literature by incorporatinf statistical analysis of the results to motive a more sounding discussion on the significance of observable results.

# Data sets

For practicallity data sets are not included within this repository. Nonetheless, we include a direct link for downloading these sets, being the ones used for experimentation on the article that this supplementary material accompanies. *(To download datasets: <a href="url">doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/MXNV9)</a>*
